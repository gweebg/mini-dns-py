This is a to-do list containing everything that is still missing in this project:

List element marks: ✅, ❌, ⌛

⌛ - Make a good implementation of ttl-cache.
    - Elements must be removed using the ttl provided.
        - Either use threads to wait x amount of seconds before deleting the data.
        - Or keep data in memory, just don't let them access it.
    - Define cache entry.
    - Implement base operations.
    - Unit test.
    - Must be an implementable module (ex. class Server(Cached): ...)

    Be careful with thread/process safety, the server has two main processes that will need to share the cache
    and each process may create a thread that will also work with the cache.
    Multiprocessing queue ? multiprocessing.Queue(.put(), .get())

✅ - Overall check on the parsers.

✅ - Add rest of features to transfer zone.

⌛ - Fix the testing environment.
     ✅ - Add hierarchy diagram like the one in docs/dns-hierarchy.txt .
     ⌛ - Write every database file.
       ? Hosts on TLD's ?
       ? Resolution server's configuration, database files ?

✅ - Figure order of events when running queries.

⌛ - Make the report.
