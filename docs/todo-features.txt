This is a to-do list containing everything that is still missing in this project:

List element marks: ✅, ❌, ⌛

⌛ - Make a good implementation of ttl-cache.
    - Elements must be removed using the ttl provided.
        - Either use threads to wait x amount of seconds before deleting the data.
        - Or keep data in memory, just don't let them access it.
    - Define cache entry.
    - Implement base operations.
    - Unit test.
    - Must be a implementable module (ex. class Server(Cached): ...)

    Be carefull with thread/process safety, the server has two main processes that will need to share the cache
    and each process may create a thread that will also work with the cache.
    Multiprocessing queue ? multiprocessing.Queue(.put(), .get())

❌ - Overall check on the parsers.

❌ - Fix the testing environment.

⌛ - Figure order of events when running queries.

⌛ - Make the report.
