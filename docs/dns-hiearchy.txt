Example hierarchy:

                      . g700. (root)
                      |
                      |
          |-----------|-----------|
          |                       |
          |                       |
out.g700. .                       . off.g700. (tld)
          |                       |
          |                       |
          .                       .
       in.out.g700.             on.off.g700. (auth)

Resolution server must have some sort of mechanism to determine if a reponse is either a reference (when there is no
match but the server knows where the domain is) or an answer (when we finally get the query answer). This can be
implemented using a flag. We can encapsulate a DNSPacket, for example:

    class ReferencedDNSPacket(BaseModel):

        base_packet: DNSPacket
        is_reference: bool

        ...

Longest prefix match on domains when asking the root, tld, etc., until finding the correct domain.
